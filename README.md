# NLP Search Engine â€” Contextual Query Matching

A simple NLP-based search engine that uses semantic similarity to return contextually relevant results.

## Overview
The project implements a basic search engine that applies NLP preprocessing and semantic similarity to match user queries to a set of documents. Focus is on improving the relevance and ranking of returned results.

## Features
- Text preprocessing: lemmatization, tokenization, stopword removal
- Semantic similarity via vector-based models (TF-IDF, word embeddings, etc.)
- Custom ranking algorithm for contextually relevant results
- Evaluation using precision, recall, and F1-score

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- Pandas, NumPy
